# Bandwidth.Standard.Model.MachineDetectionConfiguration
The machine detection request used to perform <a href='/docs/voice/guides/machineDetection'>machine detection</a> on the call. Currently, there is an issue where decimal values are not getting processed correctly. Please use whole number values. We are working to resolve this issue. Please contact Bandwidth Support if you need more information.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Mode** | **MachineDetectionModeEnum** |  | [optional] 
**DetectionTimeout** | **double?** | The timeout used for the whole operation, in seconds. If no result is determined in this period, a callback with a &#x60;timeout&#x60; result is sent. | [optional] [default to 15D]
**SilenceTimeout** | **double?** | If no speech is detected in this period, a callback with a &#39;silence&#39; result is sent. | [optional] [default to 10D]
**SpeechThreshold** | **double?** | When speech has ended and a result couldn&#39;t be determined based on the audio content itself, this value is used to determine if the speaker is a machine based on the speech duration. If the length of the speech detected is greater than or equal to this threshold, the result will be &#39;answering-machine&#39;. If the length of speech detected is below this threshold, the result will be &#39;human&#39;. | [optional] [default to 10D]
**SpeechEndThreshold** | **double?** | Amount of silence (in seconds) before assuming the callee has finished speaking. | [optional] [default to 5D]
**MachineSpeechEndThreshold** | **double?** | When an answering machine is detected, the amount of silence (in seconds) before assuming the message has finished playing. If not provided it will default to the speechEndThreshold value. | [optional] 
**DelayResult** | **bool?** | If set to &#39;true&#39; and if an answering machine is detected, the &#39;answering-machine&#39; callback will be delayed until the machine is done speaking, or an end of message tone is detected, or until the &#39;detectionTimeout&#39; is exceeded. If false, the &#39;answering-machine&#39; result is sent immediately. | [optional] [default to false]
**CallbackUrl** | **string** | The URL to send the &#39;machineDetectionComplete&#39; webhook when the detection is completed. Only for &#39;async&#39; mode. | [optional] 
**CallbackMethod** | **CallbackMethodEnum** |  | [optional] 
**Username** | **string** | Basic auth username. | [optional] 
**Password** | **string** | Basic auth password. | [optional] 
**FallbackUrl** | **string** | A fallback URL which, if provided, will be used to retry the machine detection complete webhook delivery in case &#x60;callbackUrl&#x60; fails to respond | [optional] 
**FallbackMethod** | **CallbackMethodEnum** |  | [optional] 
**FallbackUsername** | **string** | Basic auth username. | [optional] 
**FallbackPassword** | **string** | Basic auth password. | [optional]
