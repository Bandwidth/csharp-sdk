Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**FileUrl** | **string** | The URL of a media attachment.  For MMS, the API limits file size to 3.5MB. Specific carriers and channels may have a smaller limit that could cause a large file to fail, see [here](https://support.bandwidth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014235473-What-are-the-MMS-file-size-limits) for more details. |
