# Bandwidth.Standard.Model.TransferCompleteCallback
This event is sent to the transferCompleteUrl of the A-leg's <Transfer> verb when the transferred call (B-leg) completes. In a simultaneous ringing scenario, only one B-leg succeeds and this event corresponds to that successful leg. If none of the calls were answered, the transferComplete event corresponds to one of the legs.
